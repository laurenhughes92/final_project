This is the work for my final project. I have included two jupyter notebooks
Where I have done my work and the NHS Workforce Data file that contains the 
dataset I have used. 
Notebook HCS Gender contains data looking at gender distribution of staff in 
healthcare science. Total gender contains gender distribution of staff across 
the NHS. At the end of the total notebook, I have imported my final cleaned 
data from HCS gender data, and compared the two data sets. 

:w!
