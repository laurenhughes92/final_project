My project is looking at differences in gender in NHS staffing. There are two jupyter notebooks: one with the Healthcare science workforce data, and one with the total NHS data. 
At the end of the HCS data I have exported the cleaned data as a CSV file and imported it into the total NHS data to look at whether there are any differences between the gender distribution of staff in HCS compared to the whole NHS. 
I have cleaned up the data and then looked at gender distribution across each band from band 4 to band 9 and applied various analysis to look at whether there are any gender biases.
